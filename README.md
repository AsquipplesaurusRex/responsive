responsive
==========

I chose to render "Dice" for the Blackberry Bold 9900: 640x480px

NOTE: as far as I can tell I've implemented the device responsive design correctly... here's what happens when I load it on my blackberry (which honestly may be part of the unreliability of blackberry as much as a possible error... because I can't figure out what the hell is wrong!): The page first loads with the page scaled so users can't zoom in with No Dice! and Dice! displayed one on top of the other.  Then the page changes to just Dice! with no background.  Then the page changes to No Dice! with the No Dice! background.  Honestly, this is ridiculous... even though my constraints clearly indicate a device size greater than that of the blackberry for the No Dice! design, it still loads, AND they all load three in succession?  I don't know, this is discouraging... let me know if there's anything blatantly wrong with my code.
